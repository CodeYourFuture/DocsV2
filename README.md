# Welcome to CodeYourFuture Docs

CodeYourFuture is a non-profit volunteer-run coding community for refugees, asylum seekers and other disadvantaged groups. We offer a free nine-month software development program with the aim of preparing the students for a job as a junior developer. We meet one day a week to teach the course, and when arranged we also meet outside of this day to help students with coursework and projects.&#x20;

In this website you'll find all of the documentation we use to run and organise CodeYourFuture.

CodeYourFuture currently operates in the follow regions:

* Glasgow
* London
* North West (based in Manchester)
* West West (based in Birmingham)
* Cape Town, South Africa
