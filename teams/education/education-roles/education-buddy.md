# Education Buddy

The Buddy’s role is the role of the guide. 

This role is an ongoing commitment where you are paired with between three students for a period of a several months. It is your responsibility to be the first point of contact for help with their students problems for anything on the technical education side of the course.

Your should also attend a weekly meeting to feedback on their students progress and if their students need any additional support.”

### Classroom Rules

1. ​Follow the Code of Conduct
   * You should report any violations to the Personal Development team
2. Don't touch the keyboard.
   * Unless you're 100% certain that whatever your doing is outside of the students required understanding
3. Be empathetic. 
   * Our students come from many different cultures, have many different levels of English, have different levels of computer literacy, have many different employment statuses
4. Don't demotivate. 
   * It can be easy to demotivate students using dismissive language \(e.g. "it’s easy, just do this"\)
5. Be patient.
   * Everything takes time and they will get there in the end
6. Remember you are an expert.
   * Be aware of your blind spots when working with beginners

### Tips

_Don’t touch the keyboard_

Wherever possible direct the student to actually type the solution on their laptop rather than taking control. When you take a students laptop it disempowers and demotivates them and makes them less likely to experiment with solutions.

_Ask don’t tell_

As an assistant teacher, your job is not to understand **what** the student doesn’t understand but **why** they don’t understand it. You are in the lucky position of working closely with the students and so are uniquely placed to fix core misunderstandings in their mental models. The most important question in your arsenal is “_What do you think the answer is?_”.

_Homework in mind_

When mentoring a student you should always have the homework for the week in mind. You should be helping them to understand concepts well enough so that you can confidently say that they will be able to complete the homework to a sufficient level. If you don’t know the homework for the week, ask your Lead Teacher.
