# Education Roles

There are several roles that you can take when volunteering with the Education Team which have varying levels of time commitment and planning.

## Module Coordinator

**Time Commitment**: 3 consecutive weeks plus planning time

The module leaders lead the preparation of a module's lessons and exercises and are responsible for delivering its content. The module leaders are normally from within the group of mentors who have been around from the previous cohort and have a good feeling about how to run a class. They don't necessarily teach the full Saturday class though, as they're normally supported by other mentors who wish to teach part of it.

## Lead Teacher \(& Assistant Lead Teacher\)

**Time Commitment**: 3 consecutive weeks plus planning time

Lead Teachers are the people that deliver the content inside our weekly lessons.

## Teaching Assistant

**Time Commitment**: One teaching day per week

This is where most new mentors start as it is a good way to get to know the students and the other mentors. What the role involves: During the class, new concepts and exercises are introduced by the lead mentors. The students are then expected to practice these with hands-on exercises. The in-class assistants help students if they get stuck or they need some clarification. Mentors are not expected to come every weekend, although advanced absence notification is appreciated.

## Education Buddy

**Time Commitment**: A few hours a week, one essential meeting, - long term commitment

This role is an ongoing commitment where a volunteer is paired with between three and five students for a period of a few months. It is this volunteers responsibility to be the first point of contact for help with their students problems for anything on the technical education side of the course.

They should also attend a weekly meeting to feedback on their students progress and if their students need any additional support.

## Additional Roles

### Mid-week help

**Time Commitment**: Flexible

Some mentors can't commit their weekends but they are able to meet students midweek to help with homework, provide group project support, or help them get a better understanding of the concepts they're learning. This is evolving into a parallel stream of work that is just as valued and important as the main Weekend class. 

Normally, volunteer mentors offer help on a certain day of the week \(few hours after work for example\) and students respond if they can join. This can also be requested by the students by asking if there are mentors available to help on specific day\(s\). 

All communication is done via the cohort's Slack channel.

### Homework review

**Time Commitment**: Flexible

The homework is done as Pull Requests on the students' GitHub accounts. Mentors review and provide feedback that the students should act on.

### Graduation Project

**Time Commitment**: Six weeks at the end of the course

The graduation projects, at the end of the course, require developers who are comfortable jumping into several different roles: 

* Being the architect of the project
* Lead developer taking responsibility of PRs and their quality
* Project Management and wearing the hat of Scrum master few times. 

If you'd like to get involved in one or few of those roles, please let one of the lead mentors know.
