# Installing Ubuntu

We use Ubuntu on laptops given to students for the following reasons

* Is the most widely used version of Linux
* It runs most of the software that is used for development
* It is cheaper than Windows
* It runs a Unix command line meaning teaching terminal is easier

If you have a problem with any of these steps you can ask for help in **\#ask-tech-help** on Slack

## 1\) Download Ubuntu

You should start by downloading the latest version of Ubuntu LTS from here

This will download  a ".iso" file to your computer. This file is an type of file that contains all of the files required to install Ubuntu as an operating system.

**Make sure you download the "LTS" version.** 

## 2\) Create a Bootable USB

Next you'll need a USB stick to install the .iso file to so that you can install Ubuntu from it. Follow the instructions here:

Finally, insert the USB stick into the laptop that you want to install the Ubuntu on. 

When you boot up the laptop you'll want to press either F5 or F12 to enter the "Boot Menu". From here you can choose the USB stick as the Boot Device to load the installed.
