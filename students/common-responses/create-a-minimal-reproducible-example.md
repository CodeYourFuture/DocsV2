title: Create a minimal, reproducible example

## Create the smallest possible example that demonstrates the problem with your code, then post a link to it.

### Why have I been given this link?

Someone who is trying to help answer your question will give you this link if you have not provided a "minimal reproducible example" of your problem.  
You can assume they want you to create one and to then post the link to it, in the same thread.

You will get much better help if you do this, and you will learn to solve your own problems.  

Also, it is considered a basic sign of respect for those who are volunteering their time to help you.

### So, what should I do?

* If you don't know what it means to create this kind of example. read the article: [How to create a Minimal, Reproducible Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) on StackOverflow.
* Follow the guidance of that article, to create an example on any one of the following: 
  * [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/pen/), 
  * [repl.it](https://repl.it/), 
  * [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)
  * [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/)
  * [glitch](https://glitch.com/)
* check that it really doesn't have any code that is irrelevant to the problem
* post your example on the Slack thread
