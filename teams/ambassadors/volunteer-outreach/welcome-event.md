# Welcome Event

These sessions are potential volunteers first contact with CodeYourFuture and one of the key moments in a volunteers journey. The aim of this event is to give a face to the organisation, to inform the volunteers on how we work and increase the number of volunteer we get involved in what we do.

## Goals

1. Inform new volunteers about CYF, the team structure and the roles available

* Share a summary of the last event within your posts. Here’s some advice on how to tailor the posts:
  * Liaise with CYF Ambassadors and with `@aaishah`, who leads the onboarding process, to figure out how many volunteers attended then followed through and started the onboarding process from the last event.
  * Reporting on previous events and discussing their impact inspires and encourages volunteers to continue Welcome Event roles or take them up for the first time.
  * Include in your post an update of the numbers of registered guests in Eventbrite for the event
    * Get Eventbrite statistics from someone with access to our account (likely someone from `@cyf-mgmt`)
