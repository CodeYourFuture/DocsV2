title: Selection Day
---

The selection day normally happens within one to two weeks after interviews and is when we collate all of the data that we have on our applicants and decide - as a group - who will be brought forward onto the full course.

The selection process should take between 1-3 hours depending on the amount of applicants you are evaluating.

## Aims

- To select the best possible applicants to be on our course
- To find applicants who may be too advanced for the course and for who we should find alternative arrangements
- To ensure the class balance meets CodeYourFuture’s [inclusivity aims](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rZ02vQ3Jirsd2hFVgTN0F6xKJF6yCdDH4nHJMwLjx2Y/edit#gid=0)

## Selection Categories

When you’re evaluating the applicant you should be keeping in mind that they may fall into one of three categories.

1. **Rejected**
   - This applicant is not currently ready to start our course. See reasons below.
2. **Accepted**
   - This applicant is ready to start the course and should be accepted
3. **Accepted but Advanced**
   - This applicant is ready to start the course but has a very significant amount of knowledge beyond a beginner.

### Why might an Applicant be rejected?

An applicant might be rejected because of a variety of reasons. For example:

- Personal Interviews
  - The applicant’s English (reading, spoken or written) were graded poorly
  - The applicant did not seem to understand what it meant to be a programmer
  - The applicant could not sufficiently explain when they would find time to work
  - and many more…
- Technical Interviews
  - The applicant could not sufficiently explain the code that they had written in the application process
  - The applicant obviously did not work on the technical challenge by themselves
  - and many more...
- Motivation Letter
  - The English used in the letter is poor
  - The applicant does not sufficiently explain why they want to join the course
  - and many more…

Often an applicant will be rejected for a selection of reasons spanning across their interview, technical work and motivation letter.

### What is “Accepted but Advanced”?

A small but significant portion (historically 15-20%) of the people who apply and reach the selection stage have had a significant amount of experience with programming already.

It is important that while we should not reject these people - they still come from disadvantaged backgrounds and should not be penalised for knowing too much - however advanced applicants can be very disruptive in class for applicants without experience and it may not be the best use of their time.

An “Accepted but Advanced” applicant could look like

- An asylum seeker who completed a Computer Science education in their country of origin but has no professional experience
- An amateur enthusiast who has spent years learning how to code in their own time because they have been unable to afford a bootcamp.
- A professional software engineer, refugee who has recently been given Right To Remain and is now looking for a job.

For applicants who fit into this category alternative avenues to employment might be

- Applying for work through CodeYourFuture’s network
  - If they have worked professionally before or are very advanced
- Working on Tech Projects to gain experience
  - These are internal tools that we use at CodeYourFuture that look good on a CV
  - Applicants will also receive employment coaching during this time

Whilst they’re working towards employment they should also be invited to

- Support as Teaching Assistants
  - In this capacity they are given the ability to help applicants whilst also consolidating their knowledge

It is essential that all “Accepted but Advanced” applicants are considered on a case by case basis. By their very nature, they are edge cases and must be treated as such.

It’s important that the Applicant is involved in any discussions around their involvement in the course.

## Selection Process

### Before the Meeting

Make a copy of this template to organise all of the information we have on the applicants

[[TEMPLATE] CodeYourFuture Applicant Selection](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SLzDiz2y3VH3ilWb4PB7_sZAQqo-uaMHT7I-_690aPM/edit?usp=sharing)

### During the Meeting

The aim of this event is to decide which category each of the applicants should fit into.

Everyone should split into small teams and begin to work through sets of applicants methodically. Initially, you will be looking for the obvious outliers in the applicant pool - the people who are obviously not ready for the course and the people who obviously are. It is important that you take notes on the spreadsheet to justify your decisions.

After this, you will have a selection of people who will be more towards the line, you may also have difficult decisions to make if you have a limited size of class.

#### Resolving Conflicts

For every applicant where decisions are split

- One person should stand in defence of the applicant
- One person should stand in opposition to the applicant

Each representative will then have one minute to debate on behalf of the applicant using knowledge that they have from the information available.

After they have debated, all attended must cast a vote either for or against the applicant. If a consensus cannot be reached leave the applicant for the time being and return at the end of session.

### After the Meeting

Be sure to communicate the results of the Selection Day to applicants as soon as possible

## Ranking Applicants

Applicants should be ranked on a scale of 1-10 where

![drawing](../assets/selection-day/ranking.png)

You can **only** rank applicants in whole numbers (i.e. 5.5 is **not** allowed)

Below you can find a grading rubric for each of the ranks.

You will find that applicants will often fall between rankings - try to find the most appropriate place for the applicant and record your thoughts in the notes.

### Previous Technical Experience

The aim of the technical assessment is to work out if the student should go into the “Accepted But Advanced” group.
