## What is evaluation for?

Graduation is not a gift we give our trainees. It's something they earn themselves according to objective, published, measurable criteria.

## What are our purposes in assessment? <a href="what-are-our-purposes-in-assessment" id="what-are-our-purposes-in-assessment"></a>

* **Resource allocation:** who needs help and [what](https://module-template.codeyourfuture.io/evaluation/differentiation) with
* **Quality control:** are we teaching well and [the right thing](https://module-template.codeyourfuture.io/system/iteration)â€‹
* **Fairness: **objective published criteria means everyone knows what is expected
* **Flexibility**: defining [exit criteria](https://module-template.codeyourfuture.io/evaluation/exit-criteria) per module will make it possible for us to modularise the course and allow retakes
* **Specialisation**: who could flourish by taking a specialised path

## What are not our purposes? <a href="what-are-not-our-purposes" id="what-are-not-our-purposes"></a>
