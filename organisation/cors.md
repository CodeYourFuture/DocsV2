## What is the Same-Origin policy

If you are creating a website (let's call it awesome-cyf-website.com).
This website may make requests back to your server that you want to trust.
You wrote the website, so you know that it should be making that request.

If I am a hacker creating a website (let's call it evil.com)
and I make a request to your website — from evil.com to awesome-cyf-website.com —
then you can't trust that request.
You do not know or control what my website is doing.
I could be stealing data, hacking your users or many other evil things.

To prevent this, browsers follow a rule called the Same-Origin policy.
This means that JavaScript running on a website can only make a request
to the exactly the same _origin_ as the current page.

### What is an origin

The origin is part of the URL of the request.
It is made up of the scheme (`http://` or `https://`),
the host (`example.com`) and the port
(usually blank, but can be `:3000` or `:3001`)
Here are some example URLs with their origins:

| URL                                | Origin                         |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| <https://example.com>              | <https://example.com>          |
| <https://example.com/foo>          | <https://example.com>          |
| <https://example.com/foo/bar>      | <https://example.com>          |
| <https://www.example.com/foo>      | <https://www.example.com>      |
| <https://www.example.com:3000/foo> | <https://www.example.com:8080> |

Most modern browsers will highlight the origin in the address bar.

## How can I allow a cross-origin request

Sometimes we want to make a request that is _cross-origin_.
For example, if I am building a Twitter client,
I need to be able to make requests to `twitter.com`
from a website that is not `twitter.com`.
This would be a cross-origin request — the origins do not match
and so the browser cannot follow the same-origin rule.

This would be a problem for us, however Twitter can enable special rules
to allow cross-origin requests.
They can avoid the security problems of cross-origin requests
by requiring authentication info to be included on every request
(this is commonly called an _API key_).

To allow users to make cross-origin requests, you can add some _headers_
to the server's HTTP responses
which tells the browser that we are allowing cross-origin requests.
The most important header is `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`.
This means the server says
"I allow requests to be made from these origins" to the browser.
You can list specific origins like this:

```text
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: example.com,awesome-cyf-website.com
```

Or you can allow any origin like this:

```text
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

## CORS in Node/Express

You can add a header to a response in Node/Express using the `res.header()` function:

```js
app.get("/foo", function(req, res) {
  res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
});
```

The first argument is the name of the header and the second argument is the value.

This can become quite tedious to add to every request.
Instead we can use a package from npm called
[cors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors).
Once you have installed it (using `npm install`),
you can add it to your server like this:

```js
var cors = require("cors");

app.use(cors());
```

Normally you would do this once,
where you are creating and setting up the Express server.
