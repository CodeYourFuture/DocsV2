## Class structure

Our Saturday class is normally held at [Collabor8te](https://collabor8te.co.uk/) ([22 Montrose Street, G1 1RE](https://goo.gl/maps/C6aFxhqyvqz)) between 11am and 5pm, including a 1 hour lunch break.
We get a donation from [Pret a Manger](https://www.pret.co.uk/) for each Saturday class but we also very much welcome mentors and students bringing along their own food!
Food is brought by mentors and students who wish to do so and shared amongst everyone—there is no requirement to bring food, but it’s a nice way to contribute.

Please understand and follow the [house rules](../../students/house-rules.md) for the classes.

## Module structure

We split our course into modules, consisting of 3 weeks of material taught every Saturday followed by a revision week where mentors and students are not required to meet up on a Saturday.

At the end of each module, we run a retrospective and take actions based on the students' feedback.

## Homework

Students receive around 15-20 hours of homework every week.

## Extra help

Mid-week face to face meetings and online sessions are also regularly organised between mentors and students to help with homework.
This is done on an ad-hoc basis and on days, times and venues arranged between those taking part in the arrangement.

## Graduation project

The graduation projects take place at the end of the course and are real-life projects that we attempt to pair with an external organisation such as another [NGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization).
For example, in the first Glasgow cohort students built an app for a sustainable food map of Glasgow in collaboration with [Kinning Park Complex](https://www.kinningparkcomplex.org/), and a Glasgow welcome pack in collaboration with [Refuweegee](https://www.refuweegee.co.uk/).

The purpose of the graduation project is to get students working in an environment that is similar to the workplace.
This will get them familiar with various methodologies that real world software teams work in, such as:

- [Agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) (as opposed to a [waterfall model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model))
- Working in a [scrum framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development) which involves:
  - A [product owner](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Product_owner>), [scrum master](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Scrum_master>) and development team
  - A daily stand-up
