# Student Selection Process

All CYF branches are required to follow the [selection process guidelines](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/course-processes/before-the-course) to select the students from all eligible applicants.  This includes the following requirements: 

* Eligible applicants must be clearly informed at the start of the selection process about the timings and requirements of the process; 
* Eligible applicants must be interviewed face to face \(whether in person or virtually\) as part of the selection process;
* Independent 3rd party reviewers must be involved in the selection process to ensure fairness and transparency; and
* Any documentation relevant to the selection process should be available in advance to all students considered for selection.
