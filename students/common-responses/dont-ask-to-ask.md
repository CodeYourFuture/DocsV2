## Don't ask to ask your question - Just ASK it!

### Why have I been given this link?

Someone (maybe a volunteer, maybe a bot) may give you this link if you have asked "is it okay to ask a question?", or "Can someone help me with a problem?"  This is considered by many to be poor online etiquette.  You will get a better response if you ask your question immediately in the first post.

### So, what should I do?

Just *ask your question*.

In future, just ask your question immediately - do NOT ask "Can I ask a question?" or things like "Is anyone around?"

Also, try to prepare your question for the best chance of a good answer, and to respect volunteers' time.  See: 
https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask for some advice on this.
