## Start-of-class checklist - For Everybody
1. Have a notebook beside you
1. **close unwanted programs** and browser tabs

1. If you have problems, Say on **Slack** (If possible, on Zoom in "participants" click "No", too)

1. **start Zoom** (the desktop client, not phone or web, if possible).  [Download is here](https://zoom.us/download)
1. **Join** the zoom call
1. Set your **name** clearly (not "phone" or "coder")
1. Put your **webcam on**
1. Check your **mic** is working
1. **mute** your mic
1. Check you can **screenshare**
1. **Switch on CC** - "closed captions"
1. Check you can switch between **"gallery view"** and "speaker view"
1. Go to "participants" and click "YES" (this tells the teacher you are ready!)
1. **Help other students** to complete their checklist

## Getting attention when you have a problem

Here are some ways you can communicate if you have technical problems:
 * Unmute your microphone, and ask!
 * Write your problem on Slack
 * Open "participants" and click the "No" button
 * Raise your hand on camera or make a "thumbs down", on camera.  Hold it there.
 
Most importantly, listen to your teachers for the ways *they* want you to communicate problems.
