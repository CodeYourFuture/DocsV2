# Student Application Process

All CYF branches must follow the CYF application process guidelines to identify [eligible applicants](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/course-processes/before-the-course/course-eligibility). This concerns every step of the application process: web tutorials, creation of web content, continuous iteration, and quality checks against our predefined criteria. 

Where changes to the application process are required, whether due to general improvement work or CYF branch specifics, these need to be raised with the Global Education Team in advance and agreed before implementation.
