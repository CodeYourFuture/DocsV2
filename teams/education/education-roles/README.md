# Roles

## Module Coordinator

## Additional Roles

### Mid-week help

**Time Commitment**: Flexible

Some team members can't commit their weekends but they are able to meet trainees midweek to help with coursework, provide group project support, or help them get a better understanding of the concepts they're learning. This is evolving into a parallel stream of work that is just as valued and important as the main Weekend class.&#x20;

Normally, team members offer help on a certain day of the week (few hours after work for example) and trainees respond if they can join. This can also be requested by the trainees by asking if there are any volunteers available to help on specific day(s).&#x20;

All communication is done via the cohort's Slack channel.

### Coursework review

**Time Commitment**: Flexible

The coursework is done as Pull Requests on the trainees' GitHub accounts. Volunteers review and provide feedback that the trainees should act on.

### Graduation Project

**Time Commitment**: Six weeks at the end of the course

The graduation projects, at the end of the course, require developers who are comfortable jumping into several different roles:&#x20;

* Being the architect of the project
* Lead developer taking responsibility of PRs and their quality
* Project Management and wearing the hat of Scrum master few times.&#x20;

If you'd like to get involved in one or few of those roles, please let one of the lead mentors know.
