## Problem

At CodeYourFuture, we have a very limited amount of time with our students - only one day per week - and so the amount of time that our students spend with teachers is limited. In particular, our teachers time is split between 15-30 students depending on the size of the class meaning it is hard to tailor our lessons to any student.

## Solution

By running weekly Study groups we give the student a safe space to explore ideas and work through their coursework in a guided manner. Some of our students can get overwhelmed when working on their homework and so having an experienced, professional developer to help them is a huge benefit.

## Goals

- To provide support to our students during the week outside of classes
- To keep students encouraged throughout the week and stop them becoming discouraged
- To provide closer one-on-one mentoring or tutorials or our students
- Get to know real developers - many of our students have never met one before joining the course!

## Example Agenda

- 17:30 - [Volunteers Onboarding](#volunteer-onboarding)
- 18:00 - [Student to Volunteer Assignment](#student-to-volunteer-assignment)
- 18:10 - [Working Time](#working-time)
- 19:45 - [Wrap Up](#wrap-up)

### Volunteer Onboarding

- Explain the goals of the Homework Club
  - We are here to mentor, teach and advise. Not to give answers
  - Re-enforce why this is so valuable for the students as they have so little time with professionals
- Send a link to what the students have learnt in the syllabus most recently
  - This can be found [here](https://syllabus.codeyourfuture.io)

### Student to Volunteer Assignment

- As the students arrive ask them what they have been working on this week and see if any volunteers feel comfortable with helping them with that topic
  - This is to set expectations with the student as to the level of help they’ll get
- If we have more students than mentors try to group them together by the task they’re working on
- The students and mentors will take a table together and start to work
  - If working online - they can use a Breakout Room

### Working Time

- In this time students and mentors work together

### Wrap Up

As you reach the end of the session you should

- Bring all the attendees back into the main room and thank the mentors for coming
- Let everyone know that they have fifteen minutes to wrap up
  - Mentors should be encouraged to give further reading material
- Remind the mentors to fill in the Tracker
- If they aren’t already, invite the mentors to join this Slack channel as a Single Channel Guest
