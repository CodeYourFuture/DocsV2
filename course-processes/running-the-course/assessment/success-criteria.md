# Success Criteria

At Code Your Future, our goal is to get our trainees good jobs in tech. Graduation is not the goal. Graduation is a personal achievement on the road towards success, but the _goal_ is a good job in tech. When talking about ‘successful’ graduates, we mean _employable_, so we define this as a graduate with a good job in tech.

This applies, clearly, only to those graduates with the right to work. Members of CYF without the right to work are not included in our employment statistics.&#x20;

### How are good jobs in tech defined?&#x20;

#### Let’s define a good job as:&#x20;

* A fair, safe, and respectful work environment&#x20;
* A starting salary around (or above) the median household income, or with clear progression towards this&#x20;
* Opportunities for career advancement&#x20;
* Something you are interested in and enjoy

#### &#x20;Let’s define ‘in tech’ as:&#x20;

* A developer role in any company&#x20;
* A DevOps/Cloud role in any company&#x20;
* A product or delivery role in a software development team&#x20;
* A QA or test role in a software development team
* A UX/UI role in a software development team
