# Volunteering Structure

Volunteers are considered the central structure of the CYF organisation at local level.  All CYF branches must be committed to the creation of volunteering leadership teams across four key areas:

* [Outreach/Ambassador](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/teams/ambassadors), 
* [Education](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/teams/education), 
* [Personal Development](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/teams/personal-development), 
* and Tech Projects/Employment (“Volunteer Areas”). 

For a successful volunteer programme, CYF requires all CYF branches to implement the following: 

* Train and support volunteers in the Volunteer Areas;
* Volunteers must be actively working and communicate with their team on a weekly basis (“Engaged Volunteers”);
* At least 5 Engaged Volunteers are required for each Volunteer Area to ensure sustainable distribution of the responsibilities and efficient service delivery;
* All volunteers are to be treated with respect, equanimity, and be offered learning and growth opportunities; and
* Volunteers who form part of the leadership teams are expected to go through a formal [volunteer selection process](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/volunteering-codeyourfuture/onboarding-process).
