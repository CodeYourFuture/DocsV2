# NGO Dashboard - Step by step guide for volunteers

**Background Information**

The NGO \(Non-Government Organisation\) Dashboard is something currently in development at CYF. The end goal is for us to have a visual representation of NGOs relationships which we can use to map the contacts we make. Particularly those that have referred applicants \(including the applicant’s progress\) and will be a good tool to use for strategising when launching a new class or City. NGO’s are invaluable when it comes to recruiting applicants, they often work closely with disadvantaged people so are a direct link for us.

NGOs can sometimes share posters or email information for us on a mailing list, invite us to events or offer to share our information on social media.

We are currently at Stage 1 of the dashboard - gathering data from calls to NGOs. Instructions for adding call data are below.

If you would like to suggest an NGO we should make contact with, please fill in [this form](https://forms.gle/Ycs2iP9cm1CXQftg7) then inform the relevant City Coordinator \(listed below\) once complete.
