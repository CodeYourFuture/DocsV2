title: English Reading Task - Interviewer's Guide
---

## What's the aim?

The aim is to check the candidate's ability to read a simple _written_ task statement in English and to follow it step by step. Is their comprehension of written English ok? Can they focus? What attention to detail have they?

## Instructions for the interviewer

Set the candidate at ease:

- This is a really short task!
- This task doesn't require ANY coding at all!
- Spelling mistakes do NOT matter in this task!

### If the candidate CAN share their screen and type

- Give them this list of instructions
  - https://gist.github.com/nbogie/b9a3e377607b85754f71ff3043bc68eb
- Ask them to read and follow the instructions, step by step.
- Remind them there is no hurry - it is not a timed task.
- Ask them to "think out loud" where possible, but make it clear you will be silent.
- (An early instruction will have them screenshare so you can watch.)
- Do not clarify the text for them unless it's obviously our fault.

### If the candidate cannot share their screen or type

- As interviewer, share their screen and check the candidate can see it
- Start an editpad document: https://www.editpad.org/
- Paste the relevant instructions to it from here: https://gist.github.com/nbogie/b9a3e377607b85754f71ff3043bc68eb
  - Just the sections "Notes" and "Main task"
- Move your cursor to underneath the instructions
- Check if the candidate can see the instructions
- Prompt the candidate to read the instructions from your screenshare
- Prompt the candidate to tell you exactly what to type.
  - (This may include typing characters, moving the cursor, typing into google, scrolling, pausing to let something be read.)
  - Try not to infer too much.

## Taking Notes

- Was the candidate able to focus?
- How was the candidate's attention to detail?
- Did the candidate struggle with understanding the written instructions?
- How much verbal explanation of the "main task" did you have to give? (ideally, none)
