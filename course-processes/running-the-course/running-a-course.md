# Running a Course

## 1\) Module Preparation

### 1.1\) Finding Teachers

CodeYourFuture teaches seven technical modules \(consisting of three weeks each\) and eight personal development days. You can find an overview of these sessions [here](https://syllabus.codeyourfuture.io/overview).

Each of these sessions require volunteers to be 

* [Lead Teachers](../../teams/education/education-roles/lead-teacher.md)
* [Teaching Assistants](../../teams/education/education-roles/teaching-assitant.md)

A large portion of coordinating classes is finding people who are skilled in the topic that be able to teach. 

Ideally, we should be looking for **at least two** lead teachers per module as well as a number of teaching assistants to help them.

### 1.2\) Preparing Teachers

Before the class, teachers should meet to discuss how they want to prepare for the class. This could include

* Parts that they want to use Live Coding for
* Parts that they want to use presentations for
* How they want to split the content between them

They will also want to review all of the content in the lesson to understand how they will deliver it.

Additionally, they should understand what coursework is going to be assigned for that lesson so they understand what the trainees need to understand. 

## 2\) Volunteers

### 2.1\) Onboarding

As new volunteers join the team, they will need to be onboarded both to CodeYourFuture and to the local city volunteers. This might include

1. A short call with them to get them up-to-date with what is happening
2. A message on Slack to introduce them to the community
3. Giving them a co-volunteer who they can ask questions to if they have them
4. Informing them of next step about how to get move involved.

This is an important step to retaining volunteers over the longer term.

## 3\) Trainee Tracking and Issues

### 3.1\) Buddy Check-ins

Our Buddy's are one of the key ways that we get oversight of the development of our students through the course.

In order to stay in-sync and to share knowledge semi-regular Buddy check-ins should take place so that 

### 3.2\) Assessments



## 4\) Class Communication
