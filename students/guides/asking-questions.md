In order to make is easy for people to answer your questions when asking for help it's important that you have the following information

- The homework that you're working on
- What isn't working in your code or what you don't understand
- What you expect to happen
- A link to your code on Github

You should use this template:

```markdown
Homework:
Problem:
Expected:
Code:
```

For example

```markdown
Homework: Create a Website
Problem: The Headings on my website don't look right.
Expected: The heading should be much bigger than the other text on the page. I've tried to use a H1 tag but it doesn't work
Code: https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/my-website/pull/46
```
