# Social Media Guide

Please review our [**Social Media Deck**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SlcqZbgei1u7Xl6faddI67-y1GmXjyE0Wnw7Ksp9NHA/edit#slide=id.g8019bb5617\_0\_0)** **that will give you an idea of what we do and why.

_For access to the relevant social media channels, ask your local coordinators._

**Things to keep in mind when writing a post:**

* If you are promoting an event, always include the date and time + location (if physical)
* Please check that you use the correct tracking link based on where you will post the content
  * Tracking links are in the first tab of the [Social Media Calendar](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18gOgQGzoTPuTrXjVWQpODwGYJmizTPD05vZii0XLl5k/edit#gid=562835470)
  * If you need a new/particular tracking link, you can ask @Roberta or create one yourself using [https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/campaign-url-builder/](https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/campaign-url-builder/) (but please then make sure you add that to the Social Media Calendar)

**How to use an image**

* We often use Canva to create annotated images/banners that we publish on social media
* Ask @Roberta or your Country coordinator for our Canva log-in details
* Make sure your image has the correct dimensions to be published properly on social media
* Generally speaking, square images like [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iCrmEwMEk4\_MkSP7UD9llFMjffthn47Q/view?usp=sharing) (not too narrow or long) tend to be adaptable across different mediums

Please share feedback or ideas in the cyf-ambassadors Slack channel.

Happy Posting!
