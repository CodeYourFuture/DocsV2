        <p>As a Buddy you should check in with your students at least once every
          two weeks - however you may need to give some students more time if their
          need it.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>In these sessions you should make sure you access the students understanding
          of the content they&apos;ve been covering recently.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>If they need it, you should also find them the resources they need to
          succeed - including mentoring support, online study resources and access
          to study groups or peer learning.</p>

        <p>It is your responsibility to make sure that students are submitting their
          coursework and to make sure that it is being marked and feedback is being
          given.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>This does not mean that you need to mark all of the homework yourself
          - just that you are responsible for making sure it happens. You should
          make the use of the other volunteers in your city to spread the work.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>It is important that we impress on our students how important the homework
          is.</p>

        <p>As the person who works closest with the student you will have some of
          the best insights into how well they are performing in the course. For
          this reason, it&apos;s important that you share what you know with the
          rest of the team.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>This is important because if one of our students has an issue then that
          is an isolated issue - however if lots of students have the same problem
          then we have a systemic issue which should be fixed at the class level.</p>
