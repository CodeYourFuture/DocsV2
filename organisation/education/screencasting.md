- [Wes Bos: "How We Record, Edit, and Host Our Courses"](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-we-record-edit-and-host-our-courses/id1253186678?i=1000449376070) (mac-based, up-to-date (2019))
- [Kent C. Dodds "Creating a Screencast: 1 - Equipment, Software, and knowledge validation"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJMEiyK7sEc) (2016, mac)
- [Article: "Recording a great coding screencast"](https://egghead.io/articles/recording-a-great-coding-screencast)
- [A pattern language for Screencasting](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1943226.1943234)

### Software:

- https://obsproject.com/ A good free solution for streaming or video recording.

### helpful IDEs with multi-user support

- https://glitch.com/
- https://codesandbox.io/
- https://repl.it/site/multiplayer
- https://www.openprocessing.org/ (multi-user is only in beta)
- Visual Studio Live Share - (vscode? it has audio support but likely for small numbers)

### misc

- https://gitduck.com/ - non-live. video-recording sync'd to content on github.
- https://www.sli.do/ a queue of questions (can be moderated). For us it's probably best to still do this in slack.
