The final projects for a CYF class are expected to take around four weeks, beginning with an introductory session where the students form groups (unless they are already part of one) and select their projects and ending with a presentation on what they’ve built and what they’ve learned through it, in preparation for their graduation.

### Goals

For the students, a final project should give:

- Experience of collaborating on a project together, including:
  - Planning the work by divinding the tasks
  - Keeping their commitments
  - Using git to bring all of their changes together
- A practical opportunity to work with real stakeholders and requirements, as well as practice some other skills (e.g. some students have done user research, built paper prototypes)
- A chance to bring together the different technologies the students have been using (React frontend, Node/Express backend, SQL-based database) and reinforce their understanding of the bigger picture of a web application
- A real example to refer to when applying for jobs and attending interviews (useful for demonstrating both technical and soft skills)

For CYF (or a partner organisation), it would be nice to have an useful piece of software that can then be used as is or build upon at the end of the project, but the students’ learning and experience is more important.

### Projects

A good project should:

- Have a clear overarching outcome or goal to guide the students and mentors in setting priorities (e.g. starting with a concrete “business problem” to solve)
- Have an interested and empowered stakeholder available to correspond with - and ideally meet at least fortnightly with - the project team, primarily to clarify requirements and provide feedback on the group's iterations (remote meetings are ok)
- Have realistic expectations of where a group of students will be able to get to in a month (particularly important when working with partner organisations)
- Not have too much complex visual design (otherwise students spend a lot of time trying to match styling instead of working on the actual functionality)
- Be “full stack”, i.e. have features that touch the server and the client (this lets students experiment with ways of splitting up the work and helps them figure out what kind of tasks/roles would be most interesting to them)
- _If an existing project_, have someone who can guide the students through what’s already in place (otherwise it’s very overwhelming to figure out how the existing software fits together and where their changes might need to go)
- Predominantly use the technologies students have learned so far (there is some precedent for others, e.g. using Neo4j with Humankind but it adds a lot of learning overhead and will limit how much product progress can be made)

## Submitting a project

Have a project that you think would be good for our students to work on. [Check out this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-rj0NAncIhIZuay6TXEyUeuXFFUnE7vmN12223rHZOI/edit?usp=sharing).
