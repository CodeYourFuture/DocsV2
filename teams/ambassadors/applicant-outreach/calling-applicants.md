# Calling Applicants

There are three stages for an applicant:

* \*\*\*\*[**'Intro To Coding'**](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/course-processes/before-the-course/application-process) - An online course tutorials and the creation of mini web projects. If they succeed in this, they are invited for an interview \(if they pass the eligibility criteria. These tutorials and mini projects usually take a few weeks - longer if people haven't coded before. Find here the [Application Process](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/course-processes/before-the-course/application-process)
* \*\*\*\*[**The fundamental**](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/our-courses/fundamentals) ****- an intensive month long course, with classes on the weekends 
* [**The Full Stack 8-month course**](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/our-courses/full-stack-course)\*\*\*\*

While the applicants are working on the tutorials, it is important at this time to call an applicant and ensure that they are clear about the process, are receiving emails and are actively working on the tutorials.

Many applicants suffer from isolation and depression, so a call at this stage can provide a lot of motivation to students.

Once you have called an applicant, record this call on the dashboard and move onto the next one.

**Material for calling applicants**

* Call scripts will be send to you
* [F.A.Q](https://codeyourfuture.io/faq/). - especially useful when calling NGOs and Applicants
* Training will be provided

## Facebook Groups

* Research relevant Facebook groups. A lot of disadvantaged people join communities on Facebook for their geographical location i.e. Iraqi Refugees in London etc. These are great sources of applicants.
* Work with your local organisers to get access to the list of previously used Facebook Groups for your region / country.

## Word of mouth

* Use the CYF Slack channels! Post in your city and general channels when the drop ins are due to start. Of the last 110 people who completed step 1 in London - 50% came from word of mouth! 

## Workshops

* Make sure the events calendar on CodeYourFuture has the next workshop dates. Create an Eventbrite event and invite applicants to these coding workshops.
