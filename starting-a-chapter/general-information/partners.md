# Partners

Sourcing partners & sponsors will help not only with funding cohorts, but also with lots of the important other aspects of the organisation:

* **Laptop donations**: Used laptops from companies for the application process or to replace very old laptops from students
* **Trainee sponsorship**: Students need support with transportation, childcare, meal or internet and expect to raise 5K-6K to cover the costs for the 6-months program studentsâ€™ costs, however the costs may vary from each country.
* **Talks/Tours/Short experiences:** Companies can be involved by offering talks on their projects, methodologies or technologies, by giving tours of their work-places; and by providing short 1-day or 1-week work experience for the students.
