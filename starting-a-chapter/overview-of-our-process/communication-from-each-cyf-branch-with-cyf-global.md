# Communication from each CYF branch with CYF Global

Leaders of the key CYF Volunteer Areas must communicate on a weekly basis with their counterparts from other CYF branches to share knowledge and resolve common concerns. All CYF branch leadership teams must provide monthly updates on the progress of their organisation to the CYF Global Teams.
