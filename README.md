# CodeYourFuture Docs

CodeYourFuture is a non-profit volunteer-run coding school for refugees and asylum seekers. We offer a free nine-month web development program with the aim of preparing the students for a job as a junior developer. The course contains:

    HTML
    CSS
    JavaScript
    Front-end development using React
    Back-end development using Node

We meet one day a to teach the course, and when arranged we also meet outside of this day to help students with homework and projects. An important part for us is that people with privilege are meeting to help people without.

CodeYourFuture currently operates in the follow cities:

    London
    Glasgow
    Manchester
    Birmingham
    Rome
    Medell√≠n

We are currently looking at expanding to

    Cape Town
