# Getting Setup

In this guide we'll explain everything you need to get ready for our course.

## 1\) Your Laptop

Please make sure that the laptop you are using meets the minimum specification for our course. 

Check [here](../laptops/minimum-laptop-specs.md).

If your laptop does not meet the minimum specification - please contact us for a replacement. 

## 2\) Requesting Support

We can offer you a range of support whilst you are studying with us this includes

* Laptops
* Other computer hardware
* Childcare support
* Internet access
* Travel costs

**Please note:** Some of these levels of support may not be possible in the city that you attend. Please check with your city coordinator.

Please read [this page](requesting-a-laptop-or-support.md) for more details on how to access these services.

Make a backup of all of your essential files \(i.e. files you would be unhappy to lose\) from your laptop \(the one you use for CYF work\), to a DIFFERENT device.

## 3\) Backup Your Files

Over this course we may be asking you to install software or change your computer in ways.

When doing some certain tasks there is a very small risk of doing something wrong and this affecting some of the files on your laptop. For this reason we ask you to back up your laptop.

This also gives our volunteers the confidence to recommend different options when trying to make software work when it doesn't.

You could back up your files to

* The Cloud \(e.g. Google Drive or DropBox\), 
* Another computer
* An external hard disk 
* A USB stick

You MUST NOT back-up the files simply to another folder in the same laptop

You will probably have to research online to find your solution

## 4\) Operating System

You can complete our course on any Operating System we recommend that you use Linux.

If you need a laptop, please speak an organisers and we can provide you with one.

### Ubuntu \(Optional\)

We recommend using Ubuntu Linux to complete this course. This is an advanced computing skill but if you are comfortable installing this by yourself then you are welcome to, otherwise we can help you with this step.

[Download and install here](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)

### Windows

If you're using Windows we ask that you install this program to make it easier for us to help you during the course.

[Enable and install here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)

## 5\) Visual Studio Code

### 5.1\) Install VSCode

We use VS Code to write all of our code in the course. It is known as an Integrated Developer Environment and really helps you write great code!

[Download and install here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### 5.2\) Extensions

We also recommend that you install the follow extensions in Visual Studio Code.

You can install them all in one go with our [extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeYourFuture.cyf-extension-pack) or select individual extensions below.

A guide to installing extentions [can be found here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery).

### 5.3\) Enable formatting on save

We also suggest that you enable format on save so that your code stays formatted

1. In Visual Studio open the settings file \(see [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_creating-user-and-workspace-settings)\)
2. Search for `editor format`
3. Set `editor.formatOnSave` and `editor.formatOnPaste` to true
4. Set the "Default Formatter" to be Prettier
