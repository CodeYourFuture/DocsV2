# The first Ambassador Team

At this stage, you have already reached the first group of students and you have recruited some Personal Development and Education volunteers, so what is next?

1. You can now organise the first Intro to Coding Workshop 
2. Over the next 2 months you will need to organise 3 to 4 workshops a month
3. After 2 months, you should have enough applicants, so you can start interviewing  potential candidates for the Fundamentals course, who might gain access to the  Full Stack Programme. 

**And just like that, you are now about to launch your first class after 8 months! Congratulations!**\
