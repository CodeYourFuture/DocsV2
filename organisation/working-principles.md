# Working Principles

**Our working principles**

* **Put Community first**\
  Building a strong community is the most important thing. We build spaces where people meet, socialise and connect in a meaningful way.
* **Promote Self-organisation**\
  Empowered teams organise sessions, workshops and events. Our community takes the lead, shares ideas and creates change together.
* **Believe in Collective intelligence**\
  Individuals don’t have all the knowledge, the collective does. We encourage open group discussions. We challenge our community to seek support and share ideas with the group, not with individuals.
* **Create Proactivity**\
  Community members are not told what to do. We encourage our community not to rely on process and rules: trainees own their learning journey; volunteers take the lead and experiment.
* **Choose Simplicity**\
  We avoid complex language and processes. We encourage our community to focus on the essentials in the way we communicate and act. We avoid complicated jargon and elaborate processes.
* **Act with Transparency**\
  There’s nothing to be kept away from the community\*. We talk to people in open channels and in group meetings. We avoid direct messaging and private conversations as much as possible.
* **Show vulnerability**\
  No one knows everything. No one is expected to have all the answers. We teach each other to be honest about our weaknesses and to ask for help, every day.

* Events and classes with agendas and with assigned leaders running different sections
* Interactive events and physically active activities that encourages the participation of all trainees and attendees
* Interaction with trainees and attendees is organised in smaller groups that promotes collaboration and discussion
* Feedback is encouraged from all trainees and attendees by the end of the event

**What we want to avoid having:**

* Transactional classes or events without interactions, discussions, fun or community aspects

* One person controlling all the agenda and leading all day
* Volunteers being told what to do on the day
