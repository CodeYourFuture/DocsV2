# Recommended Zoom Settings for classroom hosts

These settings are made via the zoom web portal.

## Settings for ["Scheduling a new meeting"](https://zoom.us/meeting/schedule)

Link https://zoom.us/meeting/schedule

Pay particular attention to the following Meeting options:

- "Enable join before host" - `ON`
  - Otherwise, during the meeting you or a co-host will have to notice students trying to get in, and admit them one by one.
- Mute participants upon entry - `ON`
- Enable waiting room - `OFF`
  - This will silently override "Enable join before host" and will force you to manually admit students.
