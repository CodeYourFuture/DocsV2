# Re-admission to Course

Over a course some students may feel the need to stop their studies due to commitments outside CodeYourFuture. This is entirely understandable and is often a good descision for some students. 

#### **Leave of Absence** 

Students who wish to return in the future will need to request a leave of absence from the course via this [form](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/organisation/agreements-and-rules/student-agreement/leave-of-absence-request).

#### **Course Withdrawl**

Students who do not want to study in the future or are unsure how long their circumstances will last should request to withdraw from the course via this [form](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/organisation/agreements-and-rules/student-agreement/course-withdrawal-request).

## Reasons for Retaking the Course

There are several reasons why a student may want to drop out of the course and request to re-join on a subsequent course.

* Illness
* Injury
* Time constraints involving work
* Childcare time constraints
* Falling behind in the course content
* Bereavement
* Pregnancy/Maternity \([see Pregancy policy here](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/organisation/agreements-and-rules/student-agreement/student-pregnancy-policy)\)

When a student removes themselves from the course via a leave of absence, the education and personal development teams should set coursework for the student to complete in their own time.

In the case of students' English skill not being sufficient the student must complete language training courses. They should be referred by their City Coordinator to a partner organisation.

## Admission Requirements for Leave of Absence

Re-admission will not be considered under any circumstance for students that were removed from their course because of Code of Conduct violations.

In order to gain re-entry to the course students must:

1. Complete the coursework set by the Education and PD teams
2. Show significant evidence that their circumstnces have changed and they will be able to complete the full course this year

#### Resuming Studies

All taught students on a Leave of Absence are contacted prior to their scheduled return to study date by the Director of Personal Development. The student, Director of Personal Development and City Coordinator will have the opportunity to discuss their returning to study plan including when in the course they will be able to rejoin. 

## Admission Requirements for Course Withdrawal

Re-admission will not be considered under any circumstance for students that were removed from their course because of Code of Conduct violations.

   * They must show significant improvement from the first time they applied for the course
2. Show significant evidence that they will be able to complete the full course this year
