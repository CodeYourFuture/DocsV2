# Finding a Space

You will also need an office space available for the weekend classes. The space must:

* Host around 40 to 50 people;
* Have a screen/projector to present the content.
* Have wi-fi 

The exact times will vary from week to week, but should not be later than this. Companies should be ready to offer at least 2-months of their space, so that we have enough time to find an alternative space \(if necessary\). We should aim for a central location that is easy to reach by students travelling from distant towns.

Before the program starts, your teams  and trainees need to decide whether classes should be held on Saturdays or Sundays \(decide on one day and stick to it!\). However, due to COVID all classes are online at the moment.
