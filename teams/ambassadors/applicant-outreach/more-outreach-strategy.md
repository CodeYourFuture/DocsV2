# More outreach strategy

## Facebook Groups

* Research relevant Facebook groups. A lot of disadvantaged people join communities on Facebook for their geographical location i.e. Iraqi Refugees in London etc. These are great sources of applicants.
* Work with your local organisers to get access to the list of previously used Facebook Groups for your region / country.



## Word of mouth

* Use the CYF Slack channels! Post in your city and general channels when the drop ins are due to start. Of the last 110 people who completed step 1 in London - 50% came from word of mouth! 

## Workshops

* Make sure the events calendar on CodeYourFuture has the next workshop dates. Create an Eventbrite event and invite applicants to these coding workshops.
