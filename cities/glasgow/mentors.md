## What happens when I join CYF Scotland as a mentor?

Once you join, you should be added to:

- Slack
  - \#scotland channel
  - \#scotland-mentors channel
  - \#scotland-class-4 channel
  - \#scotland-education and/or \#scotland-development-and-outreach channel
  - @scotlandmentors user list
- GitHub
  - Scotland Mentors group, so that you can review PRs and collaborate on the syllabus
- Trello
  - Used for assessment of homework and graduation project work, and also used sometimes for other things like outreach
- Google calendar
  - To receive updates and changes for class dates, times and locations (please tell us when you no longer want to receive updates)

Please let us know either on Slack or through scotland@codeyourfuture.io if you have not been added to any of the above.

## Teams

In London, there are Education, Development and Outreach teams.
In Scotland, we are currently working towards delineating tasks like this but for the moment we have two teams: an Education team and a team dealing together with Development and Outreach.

The reason we have a joint Development and Outreach Team, currently, is mainly because both teams have a stake in forging relationships to help find graduates employment.

In Scotland, because we only have one member of staff, we also have the need for volunteers to help generally with Operational and Administrative tasks.
We are always trying to consolidate and grow our impact.
Developing ideas and strategies aimed towards this, though, can be time-and-resource-heavy.
Therefore, we appreciate people who are willing to help us in this type of role and contribute to planning around funding, organisation and our vision for the future.

You can find out more information on the [global Teams section](../../volunteers/teams.md)

## Module leads

Mentors can volunteer as module leads, where they lead a module (e.g. JavaScript I).
Module leads do not necessarily need to be an expert in the subject or even be the one doing the teaching—their main role is ensuring the module runs.
It is also possible to have multiple mentor leads for a single module to share the responsibilities.

The responsibilities and duties of a module lead are listed below.

### Responsibilities

- Lead mentors are responsible for ensuring the following tasks are completed to ensure the module runs smoothly
- Resources such as quizzes may already exist for most modules. In such cases these need to be reviewed/updated

### Prep

- Syllabus reviewed and tested for clarity and accuracy. A full run-through of exercises should be completed to catch any broken code
- A progress tracker should be completed for the students to track their own learning progress
- A quiz should be created to be given to students at the end of the module
- Revision material should be created for the students to do on their own during revision week
- Group projects or similar exercises should be arranged to teach soft skills, group work, Git, or similar skills during revision week

### Running the class

- Identify who will be teaching what during each week and make sure they understand the material they are teaching
- Make sure there are enough mentors to run the class each week (at least 3)
- Show up 30 minutes before class to open Collaborate, arrange desks and make sure the class can start on time
- Make sure food is available at lunch
- Make sure the course runs to time—that lunch breaks happen at appropriate times, that it ends on time, that group presentations are kept to time, etc.
- Run a retrospective on the final session of the module
- Compile the top outcomes of the retrospective and determine actions to take. Share with mentors and students
- Make sure learning outcomes are achieved during the class. If a teacher is floundering or a concept explanation didn't land, make sure it is revisited
