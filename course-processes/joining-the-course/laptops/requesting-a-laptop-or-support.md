# Requesting a Laptop or Support

## Requesting a Laptop

Please fill in the form below if you need a laptop to complete your course work in any of our currently running courses.&#x20;

You should also contact your Programme Manager that you need a laptop.

This means you do not have access to Â£300 to purchase a laptop yourself. If you are given a laptop by CodeYourFuture you agree to take care of it and return it within 14 days of the end of your course.&#x20;

If you break or loose any part of the laptop then you must contact us at [info@codeyourfuture.io](mailto:info@codeyourfuture.io) so we can arrange a replacement if we have stock available.
