# Outreach Roles

An outreach volunteer uses their communication or organisational skills to help tell the CodeYourFuture story and run events, to bring in new students, volunteers and corporate partners into our fun, inclusive community.

**The Outreach team will share responsibilities for the following;**

* Help Promoting the Organisation 
  * Identify and engage with key social media groups to promote CYF organically \(e.g. promote courses, volunteering opportunities, wider activities\)
  * Write and schedule story posts on social
* Help building relationships for and with students 
  * Reach out to NGOs and community organisations and build meaningful relationships to find students \(important orgs in regions, but not key partners\)
  * Identify volunteers that can help us reaching out to potential hiring companies
  * Reach out to new students to support them in their first step on this journey
  * Organise Demo Day/Graduation 
* Help welcoming new volunteers 
  * Organise Volunteer Event and find people from other teams to co-run it
  * Welcome new volunteers and buddy up with them to intro them to teams

You don’t have to be a professional content creator - just organised and pro-active - we’ll provide necessary training.
