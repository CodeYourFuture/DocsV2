## 3 - Schedule

1. Once your completed draft is in the Social Media Calendar, you must then schedule the post on Buffer so it can be published on the relevant social media platform on the relevant day!
   * Ask @Roberta for Buffer log-in details
   * We usually schedule posts for between 10:00 and 12:00 assuming we have one post for each platform per day
2. Once you schedule in Buffer, message @Sergei on Slack to ask him to review
