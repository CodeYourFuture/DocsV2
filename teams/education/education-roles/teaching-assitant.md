# Teaching Assitant

## Overview

The assistant teacher’s role is the role of the mentor. You are tasked with working closely with small groups or individual trainees to guide them through the lessons content. You should motivate when the trainee is feeling down, explain when the trainee is not comprehending and encourage the trainee to be inquisitive. You will be working more closely with our trainees  than anyone else in the organisation and so you are a crucial part of the relationship we have with them.

| <p>In our classrooms we often have a wide range of ability and so it is essential that we mentor the trainees  who are struggling so they don’t fall behind.</p><p>Take the time not only to teach but also to motivate and connect with the trainee. Many of our trainees  may never have met a programmer before and this can be a great opportunity for them to ask questions about your background and day to day life.</p> | <p>When interacting with trainees, try to gauge how they are doing in the lesson. Spot trainees who are doing well and those that are doing poorly. It is important you feed this back to our coordinators at the end of the day.</p><p>Giving feedback and assessing homework from the trainees ts is also an important job for you as a teaching assistant.</p> | <p>As a teaching assistant you are uniquely placed to give active feedback to your lead teacher. Never be afraid to ask the teacher to explain again if you think the trainees  don’t understand a topic or to offer extra clarification. Wherever possible, feedback to the teacher on how the trainees  you’re interacting with are doing.</p><p>Additionally, we encourage feedback on the lesson itself. We try to foster a community of growth and education for everyone at CodeYourFuture - not just our trainees .</p> |

## Training

## Classroom Rules

1. ​Follow the Code of Conduct
   * You should report any violations to the Personal Development team
2. Don't touch the keyboard.
   * Unless you're 100% certain that whatever your doing is outside of the trainees  required understanding
3. Be empathetic.
   * Our trainees  come from many different cultures, have many different levels of English, have different levels of computer literacy, have many different employment statuses
4. Don't demotivate.
   * It can be easy to demotivate trainees using dismissive language (e.g. "it’s easy, just do this")
5. Be patient.
   * Everything takes time and they will get there in the end
6. Remember you are an expert.
   * Be aware of your blind spots when working with beginners

## Tips

_Don’t touch the keyboard_

Wherever possible direct the trainee to actually type the solution on their laptop rather than taking control. When you take a trainee laptop it disempowers and demotivates them and makes them less likely to experiment with solutions.

_Ask don’t tell_

As an assistant teacher, your job is not to understand **what** the trainee doesn’t understand but **why** they don’t understand it. You are in the lucky position of working closely with the trainees and so are uniquely placed to fix core misunderstandings in their mental models. The most important question in your arsenal is “_What do you think the answer is?_”.

_Homework in mind_

When mentoring a trainee you should always have the homework for the week in mind. You should be helping them to understand concepts well enough so that you can confidently say that they will be able to complete the homework to a sufficient level. If you don’t know the homework for the week, ask your Lead Teacher.
