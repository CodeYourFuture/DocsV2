      - \#scotland channel
      - \#scotland-mentors channel
      - \#scotland-class-4 channel
      - \#scotland-education / \#scotland-development-and-outreach channel
      - @scotlandmentors user list
- GitHub
  - City mentors group, so that you can review PRs and collaborate on the syllabus
- Trello
  - Used for assessment of homework and graduation project work 
  - Used sometimes for other things like Outreach activities
- Google Groups
  - To receive updates and changes for class dates, times and locations (please tell us when you no longer want to receive updates)
