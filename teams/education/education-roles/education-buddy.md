        <p>As a Buddy you should check in with your students at least once every
          two weeks - however you may need to give some students more time if their
          need it.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>In these sessions you should make sure you access the students understanding
          of the content they&apos;ve been covering recently.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>If they need it, you should also find them the resouces they need to succeed

        <p>It is your responsibility to make sure that students are submitting their
          coursework and to make sure that it is being marked and feedback is being
          given.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>This does not mean that you need to mark all of the homework yourself
          - just that you are responsible for making sure it happens. You should
          make the use of the other volunteers in your city to spread the work.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>It is important that we impress on our students how important the homework
          is.</p>
