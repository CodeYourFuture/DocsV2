## Further Work & Projects

Even though we've finished teaching you have only scratched the surface of everything you could learn and it important that you keep your skills fresh.

The job market will always be competitive so you should continue to learn new technologies, build cool projects and develop your soft skills.

### CodeYourFuture Tech Projects

These tools are essential to helping us grow and ensure the long term growth of CodeYourFuture.

When you join the Tech Projects team you will be mentored by senior developers and work on projects that you can put on your CV as professional experience.

You may also have the opportunity to work on projects for NGO & Non-Profit companies. These projects could eventually lead to paid freelance projects in the future.

## Job Search

At this point in your coding journey you may feel ready to start applying for jobs. This is excellent and we want to work with you to help you achieve this goal.

**Important**: When you are searching for jobs, make sure you tell us you want to apply for them first so we can speak to the company. When we do this we can get a "Recruitment Fee" from the company you work. This can **be as much as Â£5000** and is an important way for us to keep on running.

Before you start you should make sure
