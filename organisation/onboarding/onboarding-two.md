As part of the volunteer onboarding, you can help out with the Intro to Coding. 

Intro to Coding is a free, self-paced online course for anyone new to coding, supported by a community of tech professionals to help you get started. Intro to Coding acts as both a course and an application process to our Full Stack course. 

You can read about the roles that volunteers play in supporting the students during the intro to coding below:
