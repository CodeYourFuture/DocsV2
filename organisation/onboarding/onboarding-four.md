After a month or two of volunteering, you can consider taking on more responsibility. 

We have general volunteer - folks who join and do occasional tasks. 

And volunteer leaders - folks who start to take on organisation of volunteer tasks. 

Our organisation needs both types of volunteers. If you are interested in becoming a volunteer leader - let your team know!
