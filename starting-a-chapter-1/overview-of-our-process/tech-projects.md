# Tech Projects

Group tech projects are integral to the learning and development of each student and form part of the CYF curriculum.  

Students must complete a tech project as part of a group before they are able to graduate. All tech projects must be led by the Tech Project Volunteer team and based on the learning benchmarks set by the CYF Global Education Team.  

Students must work together and achieve these minimum standards during the project. Students who do not partake in the group tech project will not be eligible to graduate as CYF graduates.
