# Welcome to CodeYourFuture Docs

CodeYourFuture is a non-profit volunteer-run coding school for refugees and asylum seekers. We offer a free nine-month web development program with the aim of preparing the students for a job as a junior developer.

We meet one day a to teach the course, and when arranged we also meet outside of this day to help students with homework and projects. An important part for us is that people with privilege are meeting to help people without.

CodeYourFuture currently operates in the follow cities:

* London
* Glasgow
* Manchester
* Birmingham
* Rome 
* Cape Town
