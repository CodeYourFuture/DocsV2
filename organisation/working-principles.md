**What is expected from a CYF program?**

- Empowered volunteers through defined roles & responsibilities
- Events and classes with agendas and with assigned leaders running different sections
- Interactive events and physically active activities that encourages the participation of all students and attendees
- Interaction with students and attendees is organized in smaller groups that promotes collaboration and discussion
- Feedback is encouraged from all students and attendees by the end of the event
- Social spaces are created and fostered where people can meet, discussions are essential in any class or event

**What we want to avoid having:**

- Transactional classes or events without interactions, discussions, fun or community aspects

- Classes and events where attendees are sitting all day

- Masterclass/boardoom/lecture atmosphere and dynamics

- One person controlling all the agenda and leading all day

- Volunteers being told what to do on the day
