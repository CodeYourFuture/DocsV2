# Starting a Course

**Note:** This guide is used by **Volunteers and City Coordinators** to setup a new class. If you are a trainee, you do not need to use this guide.

## 1) Send Acceptance and Rejection Email

As soon as possible after selection, send the trainees either their Acceptance or Rejection emails to the Full Stack course.

You can find the template Acceptance emails here: [https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1tFm22lHTXKTdbTGUJj_F0awRgDP19YAL](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1tFm22lHTXKTdbTGUJj_F0awRgDP19YAL)

You can find the template Rejection emails here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jyOVbwjm23YfpIYjq1KUzRNL7cKzSrYEDi2I9Mezt7g/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jyOVbwjm23YfpIYjq1KUzRNL7cKzSrYEDi2I9Mezt7g/edit)

## 2) Slack

### 2.1) Invite Trainees to Slack

Up until this point trainees will only have been using the "Intro to Coding" Slack workspace.

You should invite them to the main CodeYourFuture workspace now.

The easiest way to do this is to create an invite link and to send them it in an email.

### 2.2) Create Slack User Groups for Class

When all of the trainees have signed up to Slack it is useful to create a Slack user group so you can tag them all at the same time. (e.g. #north-west-class-4)

To do this, navigate to "People & User Groups" in Slack

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)

Then click "New User Group".

Give the group a name and then invite all the trainees.

### 2.3) Setup Class Channel

On the main CodeYourFuture Slack, setup a new channel for the class (e.g. #north-west-class-4) and add all trainees to it.

You should also invite key volunteers to the channel.

Be sure to write a nice welcome message for people when they join (and reminding them to complete the [Getting Setup Guide](getting-setup.md))

## 3) Setup Github Team for Class

We use Github Teams to release coursework to trainees and to give them access to the work they need.

To create a Github team, first make sure you have an Administrator privileges for the CodeYourFuture organisation on Github.

Next, go to this page and click "Add a team"

[https://github.com/orgs/CodeYourFuture/teams/students/teams](https://github.com/orgs/CodeYourFuture/teams/students/teams)

Create a new team and then invite all of the trainee to it. To do this, you will need all of their Github Usernames.

## 4) Setup Google Group Email for Class

It can be really useful to have an email address for all of the trainees in a class so that you can bulk email them (e.g. north-west-class-4@codeyourfuture.io)

To do so, make sure you have admin rights to the CodeYourFuture Google Admin page.

Next, navigate to this link

[https://admin.google.com/u/1/ac/groups](https://admin.google.com/u/1/ac/groups)

And click "Create Group".

Name the group and invite all of the trainees to it using their email addresses.

## 5) Confirm Trainee Agreement

All of the trainee should by this point have read and signed the trainee agreement - you should remind all students that it essential they do so before starting the course.

## 6) Create a new Trainee Tracker

You should use a Trainee Tracker spreadsheet to track the students progress through the course.

You can choose to either update the one that was used for Fundamentals (making sure to remove students who did not progress to the Full Stack course) or create a new one.

You can find a template for the Trainee Tracker here:

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HWrINTx0TryOWWRaAftuZAy5c7wf6Ibovw2syMsKI5s/edit#gid=1682827930](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HWrINTx0TryOWWRaAftuZAy5c7wf6Ibovw2syMsKI5s/edit#gid=1682827930)

## 7) Setup Google Classroom

Next, setup a new Google Classroom for the class by navigating [to this website](https://classroom.google.com), clicking the + symbol and clicking "Create Class".

**Note:** Do **not** copy the classroom from previous classes as the coursework will have changed and you will not get any of the updates to the Syllabus in the time since the class was run.

When you have created the class, invite all of the trainees using their email.

You should also invite key volunteers to the

## 8) Setup Class Planner

First, login with the Admin account on the Class Planner here (you can get the password from a CYF staff member):

{% embed url="https://classplanner.codeyourfuture.io/" %}

Navigate to the city that you are in, then click "New Course".

Setup the course name and the dates that it will be running.

When the course is setup, add each of the classes as they will be happening in the course.

When the course and classes are setup, share the class planner with the trainees.

## 9) Confirm Trainee's Hardware

During this time, trainees will need to make sure they have a working laptop.

To request a laptop, should complete the steps in [Requesting a Laptop or Support](laptops/requesting-a-laptop-or-support.md).

It can be helpful to have a quick ten minute call with each trainee to confirm that their webcam, microphone and internet connection are working properly in the week leading up the first class.

## 10) Send Confirmation Email

Finally, send an email to all new Trainees with an overview of

* Any final Setup Details they need to do
* Confirm the date and time of the first class
* If online - send a link to the Zoom where the class will happen
* If in person - send the address where class will be taking place

It can be useful to attach a Google Form and ask the students to confirm their attendence of the first class by completing it - this was you can tell who hasn't received the email.
