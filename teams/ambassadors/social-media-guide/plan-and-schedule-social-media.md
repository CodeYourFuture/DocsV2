## 1 - Planning

Weekly Social Media Planning Sprint  

1. Develop the ideas as a group
2. Chair assigns Social Media Ambassador to draft content - by tagging their email address in a relevant cell in the [Social Media Calendar](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18gOgQGzoTPuTrXjVWQpODwGYJmizTPD05vZii0XLl5k/edit#gid=562835470)

## 3 - Schedule

1. Once your completed draft is in the Social Media Calendar, you must then schedule the post on Buffer so it can be published on the relevant social media platform on the relevant day!
   * Ask @Roberta or the coordinator in your Country for Buffer log-in details
   * We usually schedule posts for between 10:00 and 12:00 assuming we have one post for each platform per day
2. Once you schedule in Buffer, message @Sergei or the reviewer in your country to ask them to review
