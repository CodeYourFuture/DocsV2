# Full Stack Course

## Aims

The aim of this course is to provide the trainee with enough programming knowledge to be able to get a job as a programmer. Everything else is details.

A trainee who completes our Full Stack Web Development course will:

- Have the ability to build a basic modern full-stack web application \(using NodeJS, MySQL and React\)
- Get experience with working in teams using Agile principles
- Know how to learn and self-teach new programming concepts
- Know how to use third-party libraries/APIs
- Have a basic understanding of what it means to work on digital products

## Syllabus

You can find our syllabus online here: [https://syllabus.codeyourfuture.io/](https://syllabus.codeyourfuture.io/)

## Delivery

Our course is split into three-week modules. It is the responsibility of the Lead Teachers to deliver the module to the students supported by a team of teaching assistants.

We teach one day per week in a physical location and then support the students during the week while they complete their coursework. This is primarily a self-taught course with a rigorous support structure in place to guide our students on their journey to becoming developers.

Out-of-classroom support is given in a Slack Channel where students can collaborate and ask questions to their peers and teachers. We encourage online collaboration in the form of video calls and screensharing. We also support our students with online drop-in sessions with volunteers, homework clubs and mentoring.

## Personal Development

Just as essential as the programming side of the course is that our students have the soft skills required to get and hold a job. These include:

- Time management
- Planning
- Communications
- Teamwork
- Public Speaking
