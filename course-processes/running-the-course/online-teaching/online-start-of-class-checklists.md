## Start-of-class checklist - For Everybody

1. Have a notebook beside you
2. **close unwanted programs** and browser tabs
3. Open slack and the correct **Slack channel**
4. If you have problems, Say on **Slack** \(If possible, on Zoom in "participants" click "No", too\)
5. Open the syllabus
6. **start Zoom** \(the desktop client, not phone or web, if possible\).  [Download is here](https://zoom.us/download)
7. **Join** the zoom call
8. Set your **name** clearly \(not "phone" or "coder"\)
9. Put your **webcam on**
10. Check your **mic** is working
11. **mute** your mic
12. Check you can **screenshare**
13. **Switch on CC** - "closed captions"
14. Check you can switch between **"gallery view"** and "speaker view"
15. Go to "participants" and click "YES" \(this tells the teacher you are ready!\)
16. **Help other students** to complete their checklist

## Getting attention when you have a problem

Here are some ways you can communicate if you have technical problems:

* Unmute your microphone, and ask!
* Write your problem on Slack
* Open "participants" and click the "No" button
* Raise your hand on camera or make a "thumbs down", on camera.  Hold it there.

Most importantly, listen to your teachers for the ways _they_ want you to communicate problems.
