title: Roles & Duties for class
---
Roles are given to [three teams][1], namely Outreach, Education and Personal Development - with a 4th team, Technical Project
Management which is created nearing the end of a class cohort. Each and every team fulfils different roles in order to
run the course effectively.

Volunteering members are encouraged to communicate across teams, with sole the purpose of building a
friendly, welcoming family, that prepares the students for a better future.

A volunteer can wear different hats depending on the schedule, agenda, or in special circumstances.
All roles and tasks are optional, and no one is forced, or coerced into to doing things that they do not feel comfortable with.

Code Your Future welcomes any support we can get :)

## Roles
The duties for each role vary, which require a diverse skill set and volunteering members can take on multiple roles.
