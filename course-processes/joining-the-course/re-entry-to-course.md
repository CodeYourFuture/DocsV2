# Re-admission to Course

During a course some learners may feel the need to stop their studies due to commitments outside of CodeYourFuture. This is entirely understandable and is often a good decision for some trainees.

### **Leave of Absence**

Students who wish to return to their studies in the future will need to request a leave of absence from the course via this [form](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/organisation/agreements-and-rules/student-agreement/leave-of-absence-request).

### **Course Withdrawal**

Students who do not want to study in the future or are unsure how long their circumstances will last should request to withdraw from the course via this [form](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/organisation/agreements-and-rules/student-agreement/course-withdrawal-request).

## Reasons for Retaking the Course

There are several reasons why a trainee may want to drop out of the course and request to re-join on a subsequent course.

* Illness
* Injury
* Time constraints involving work
* Childcare time constraints
* Falling behind in the course content
* Bereavement
* Pregnancy/Maternity \([see Pregnancy policy here](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/organisation/agreements-and-rules/student-agreement/student-pregnancy-policy)\)

When a trainee removes themselves from the course via a leave of absence, the education and personal development teams should set coursework for the trainee to complete in their own time.

In the case of students' English skill not being sufficient, the trainee must complete language training courses before they are able to return to their course. They should be referred by their City Coordinator to a partner organisation.

## Admission Requirements for Leave of Absence

In order to gain re-entry to the course students must:

1. Complete the coursework set by the Education and PD teams
2. Show significant evidence that their circumstances have changed and they will be able to complete the full course this year

\*Re-admission will not be considered under any circumstance for students that were removed from their course because of Code of Conduct violations.

### Resuming Studies

All taught students on a Leave of Absence are contacted prior to their scheduled return to study date by the Director of Personal Development. The trainee, Director of Personal Development and City Coordinator will have the opportunity to discuss their returning to study plan including when in the course they will be able to rejoin.

## Admission Requirements for Course Withdrawal

In order to gain re-entry to the course students must:

1. Complete the entire application process from the beginning including the applicant interview
   * They must show significant improvement in their application from the previous time they applied for the course
2. Show significant evidence that they will be able to complete the full course this year
3. \(If required\) show significant improvement in their reading, written and spoken English skill

\*Re-admission will not be considered under any circumstance for students that were removed from their course because of Code of Conduct violations.

### Resuming Studies

If accepted on the course, learners will have to meet with the Director of Personal Development, and City Coordinator to discuss their returning to study plan.
