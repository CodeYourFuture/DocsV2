title: Full Stack Web Development Course
---

## Aims

The aim of this course is to provide the student with enough programming knowledge to be able to get a job as a programmer. Everything else is details.

A student who completes our Full Stack Web Development course will:

- Have the ability to build a basic modern full-stack web application (using NodeJS, MySQL and React)
- Get experience with working in teams using Agile principles
- Know how to learn and self-teach new programming concepts
- Know how to use third-party libraries/APIs
- Have a basic understanding of what it means to work on digital products

## Delivery

Our course is split into three-week modules. It is the responsibility of the Lead Teachers to deliver the module to the students supported by a team of teaching assistants.

We teach one day per week in a physical location and then support the students during the week while they complete their coursework. This is primarily a self-taught course with a rigorous support structure in place to guide our students on their journey to becoming developers.

Out-of-classroom support is given in a Slack Channel where students can collaborate and ask questions to their peers and teachers. We encourage online collaboration in the form of video calls and screensharing. We also support our students with online drop-in sessions with volunteers, homework clubs and mentoring.

## Syllabus

You can find our syllabus online here: https://syllabus.codeyourfuture.io/

## Personal Development

Just as essential as the programming side of the course is that our students have the soft skills required to get and hold a job. These include: 

- Time management
- Planning
- Communications
- Teamwork
- Public Speaking

## Programming Content

### HTML/CSS

In this module students will learn the basic building blocks of the web: HTML and CSS. HTML gives us the power to add text, images and videos to a page. CSS enables us to organize these parts and make it look nice.

The products of HTML and CSS comprise two-thirds of what is called frontend (the final third is client-side JavaScript, which they will learn about in later modules). What is frontend? It's another word for the presentational part of a piece of software. In terms of web development we're talking about "what you see" when you go to any website.

Think of it like this: if a webpage were a person, the HTML would be the skeleton and CSS the skin and clothing!

### JavaScript 1

In this module our students make a start into the wonderful world of programming. We will be using JavaScript. Our students learn about the basic building blocks of programming: loops, functions, control flow and more. Consider these as the ABC of programming. Without them, it's impossible to write working software.

### JavaScript 2

In JavaScript 2 our students will learn all about how to use JavaScript within the browser. First, they'll learn about how HTML is structured within their browser: we call this the Document Object Model (DOM). Once they've gotten the hang of that we'll apply JavaScript to it, in order to manipulate the elements and make our pages more interactive. We call this DOM manipulation and it's one of the most interesting things about JavaScript.

### JavaScript 3

In our final JavaScript module we cover Test Driven Development and tie together everything that we've learnt in JavaScript so far. We also build a project together that helps us work on teamwork and expand our knowledge of larger uses of JavaScript

### React

In these 3 weeks we will go back to the frontend and learn how to make faster, more modern user interfaces. They'll become more familiar with a frontend technology called React.js, a JavaScript library written and maintained by Facebook.

It is mainly used to create dynamic user interfaces, changing the data a user sees depending on their input.

### Databases

In this module our students will learn all about a fundamental part of any software application: how to (safely) store data, so that it can be used on-demand. The students will learn how to structure and group data so their apps know where to find and store the correct data.

### Node.js

Any software application consists of at least 2 parts: a frontend, which is what the user sees and interacts with, and a backend. This module will expose the students to the wonderful world of backend development, where they learn all about where their data goes once they've pressed that submit button. They'll be writing web servers and learning how to send users the right feedback.

## Project

At the end of our course we work on a single large group project that pulls together everything the student have learnt on the course.

Added to this they'll learn some more cutting-edge technologies that will prepare them for a great start in a modern software company. We will start out with the basics and incrementally add more complexity. This way they'll learn how all the pieces of a RESTful API fit together, thereby gaining a deeper understanding of where the backend stops and frontend starts.

Along with practicing their programming skills, they will also be working on improving their communication skills. This is just as important, because they need to be able to communicate ideas and concepts in an easy-to-understand manner.

This project will form part of a student's portfolio that they can take to employers to help them secure a job.
