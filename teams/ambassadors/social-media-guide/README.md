# Social Media Guide

Please review our [Social Media Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SlcqZbgei1u7Xl6faddI67-y1GmXjyE0Wnw7Ksp9NHA/edit#slide=id.g8019bb5617_0_0) that will give you an idea of what we do and why.

For access to the relevant social media channels, ask your local coordinators.

Things to keep in mind when writing a post:

* If you are promoting an event, always include the date and time + location \(if physical\)
* Please check that you use the correct tracking link based on where you will post the content
  * Tracking links are in the first tab of the [Social Media Calendar](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18gOgQGzoTPuTrXjVWQpODwGYJmizTPD05vZii0XLl5k/edit#gid=562835470)
  * If you need a new/particular tracking link, you can ask @Roberta or create one yourself using [https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/campaign-url-builder/](https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/campaign-url-builder/) \(but please then make sure you add that to the Social Media Calendar\)

Please share feedback or ideas in the cyf-outreach Slack channel.

Happy Posting!
