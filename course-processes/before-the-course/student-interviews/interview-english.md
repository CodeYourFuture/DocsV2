# Interview - English

## What's the aim?

The aim is to check the candidate's ability to read a simple _written_ task statement in English and to follow it step by step. Is their comprehension of written English ok? Can they focus? What attention to detail have they?

## Instructions for the interviewer

Set the candidate at ease:

* This tasks is to help us get a sense of their ability to read in English, follow instructions and think through a problem. 
* It is a really short task - it's not timed
* This task doesn't require ANY coding at all!
* Spelling mistakes do NOT matter in this task. 

### If the candidate CAN share their screen and type

* Share with them the instructions for the task
  * [https://codepen.io/enz0/full/eYzOeVg](https://codepen.io/enz0/full/eYzOeVg)
  * Ask them screenshare so you can watch 
* Ask them to read and follow the instructions, step by step.
* Remind them there is no hurry - it is not a timed task.
* Ask them to "think out loud" where possible, but make it clear you will be silent.
* Do not clarify the text for them unless it's obviously our fault.

### If the candidate cannot share their screen or type

* As interviewer, share your screen and check the candidate can see it
* Start an editpad document: [https://www.editpad.org/](https://www.editpad.org/) \(click on the blue button 'Create new text note'
* Paste the relevant instructions to it from here: [https://gist.github.com/nbogie/b9a3e377607b85754f71ff3043bc68eb](https://gist.github.com/nbogie/b9a3e377607b85754f71ff3043bc68eb)
  * Just the sections "Notes" and "Main task"
* Move your cursor to underneath the instructions
* Check if the candidate can see the instructions
* Prompt the candidate to read the instructions from your screenshare
* Prompt the candidate to tell you exactly what to type.
  * \(This may include typing characters, moving the cursor, typing into google, scrolling, pausing to let something be read.\)
  * Try not to infer too much.

## Taking Notes

* Did the candidate understand the written instructions?
* Did the candidate ask you to clarify the instructions? 
* Did the candidate think out loud while they were doing the task? 
* How was the candidate's attention to detail?
