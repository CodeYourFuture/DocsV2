  * If you’re not, ask the incumbent Host to transfer you the Host power

  * Click ‘pause’ and ‘play’ for breaks in classes (like breakout room activities) and then ‘stop’ for end of meeting
  * If you click ‘stop’ by accident, then you can just click ‘record’ again and create multiple videos for the same class, in the worst case scenario
  * The video automatically uploads to our Zoom account cloud storage after it is stopped
* Fill in class attendance (use relevant Class Trainee Progress Tracker for your region) ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/t8Nrg-oUVEZOk2wTap0rMH9rMhJhBZc-A\_ybyuHJ4qUXiN\_GW6DfmbdrwTMt1x0C\_SllZ0rrPnj4Txn6kX9-QMiYgzFkHZPJFRQD2wTPbh7wNIqoZ4rUo7iyhuN15ORvVo\_bu\_JT)![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-QIrlZbbnEbn\_S19mYA\_7YpZcg69SqJzmZlMlN1t\_bqjox6u0JjX8v8EXvC7Aif5f\_6vj5KgWEiBVoE0wMjzqrEyVM-KQky2ZKjnUvf0T0J\_1heJYpPKzuLgTvO\_jxWfDJas4YS2)
* Create breakout rooms at the start of the meeting&#x20;
  * Create more breakout rooms than you may actually need (15+)
    * You should see a Breakout Rooms button on your Zoom panel (if not, click ‘More’ (or ‘...’) to find it
    * This is because some versions of Zoom may not allow you to add rooms after they are opened

    * Assign 2 or 3 trainees to a room
      * Assigning can be random
      * For exact number per room, please consult lead teacher

    * Announce before opening breakout rooms that TAs will begin to circulate rooms after 2 minutes have elapsed ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/MAdZAjmQ2pkmPzkJYXZlH0XZXU\_ehQAGC6QykrOzq\_OOH0HQAgDa2d99b8ZhEyFvUkB7SGCyIt9-MEzYPL539XrJ\_ydwPhqGrgxkZZMv1990YHL8AehjH63DpMyoUIY4eSaSgu35) and encourage trainees to use the Ask For Help button ![:sos:](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/DogsOSSn4hEY4dfDaCmv00OUosDKiyo-g\_QE3fZ-lCFOkKZmTGCV7ewOGs6Js0vSRFY-7IJM96OVVvwoYzYtWGfy6EInF7B9mbRWa\_RDrk8BXe0Y84QvoL7aKfLow4izZlcWgf6w)
      * This allows trainees to work together and help each other, if needed, before teacher/TAs come into the room
  * When the lead teacher gives you the signal, open the breakout rooms
* Other general admin - like making sure people are muted when the presenter is speaking; and looking out for students who are using Zoom reactions to try and ask a question or mention to the lead teacher that there is a question in the chat!

### **When you finish**

* If you are leaving before the end of the session, assign as the host the incoming Zoom Master then leave the meeting
* If you are finishing the call, just end the meeting.
* Have a well-deserved cup of tea ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/n62s8e7rkHLB74m6LHc6zNdhb-RRNnw5LneJdp7ECdcq\_driIvhXLCZEgyj1Uk4iZTRYXLoR2huJLKnXK42nMhxA5\_10igGC3gjzcmd7nZ5fhfWOcLSxdL4BUyDU06sZgyVXC9Lm)
