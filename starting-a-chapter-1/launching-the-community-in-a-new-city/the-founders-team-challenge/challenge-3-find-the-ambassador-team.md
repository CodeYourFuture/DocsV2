# Challenge 3: Find the Ambassador team

**The challenge should take 4 weeks.**  


Now that an established Founders team has been created, you will need to recruit the Ambassador team.\*

In order to recruit Ambassadors you will need to be one of them! So your outreach tasks start now!

* You will need to be the first one creating a welcome event. 
* You will most likely need to run 3 welcome volunteer events within a short period of time, 4 to 6 weeks. 
* Your goal is to recruit 50-60 potential ambassadors.

_\*Note: Until the ambassadors team has been created, you cannot recruit more volunteers or students._
